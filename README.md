# TrollingArt

## Synopsis

New and improved infraestructure for http://TrollingArt.com. As a plus to the joke, the posts will link to Wikipedia API to obtain formal references about the work, it's location and the author.

Each artist will have his own social network profile, allowing to explore every published joke related with his particular work.

## Motivation

We want to refresh the discourse of the art enciclopedia and reveal it's funny side. 

##Tests

Still a work in progress, but in the video you can see the code working: when you create a new user to the WP site v√≠a wp-admin, and give it a "Wiki JSON" URL, the code will automatically retrieve and assign to that user the correct First Name, Last Name, Nickname and Biographical info (other features from the Wiki profile to be added soon).

Afterwards, when creating or editing a post, it can be assigned to a previously created user as an artist profile, so that basic author information for the artwork is displayed right below the post main content.
